That is the perfect final touch to make your project look professional. A good README.md acts as the "front door" to your project, explaining what it is and how to use it to anyone who visits your profile.

Since you are a cybersecurity student, having a structured README shows that you prioritize documentation and clarity.

How to Add Your README
On GitHub:

Navigate to your Buraq-AI-OSINT repository.

Click the "Add a README" button (usually a green button or a link near the bottom).
